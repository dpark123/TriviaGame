# TriviaGame

This is a Spider-Man themed trivia game. When the user clicks the start button the app begins. The user will need to answer each question in order to finish. They will be notified whether or not their decision is correct or incorrecty. At the end of the gmae a result page will show letting the user know how many correct out of total questions and and provide a try again button. If the try again button is clicked the trivia will restart from the first question and their correct counter will reset as well. 

During each question the user will have 30 seconds in order to select an answer. If the user does not select an answer before the time runs out, they will automatically be incorrect. During the transition page the next question will load after 5 seconds.
